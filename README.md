# ndjson-cli-clj
This is an attempt to reproduce https://github.com/mbostock/ndjson-cli using Clojure, mainly for learning.
I just put up some separate programs but my intention has changed and it is to build a more general command-line json processor, similar to `jq` (https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).
